# Pokémon TCG Lookup

## Project Purpose:
Pokémon TCG Lookup was inpsired by my 8 year old son, who just started to play Pokémon The Card Game (TCG).  He is always asking me about a specific card or character and asking aboug them.  He wants to know who they evolve into, what other versions of the card exist, what resources do they use.  Pokémon TCG Lookup is build to answer his question, so I don't have too.  It will be built on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  The user will enter a character name and will get back all the information that they could want about that character.

## API to be used
[Pokémon TCG API] (https://pokemontcg.io/)

## Features for MVP:

###Search section
Provide search functionality to user.

###Display primary card
Display the Pokémon card associated with the name entered.  If a card is not found the user will get a modal stating that card was not found

###Display Alternate cards
The same character could have multiple cards.  so in this section.  Display all other cards.

###Display Evolution Cards
Pokémon cards come in different levels: basic, level 1 and level 2.  If a user searches for a basic card, display the level 1 and level 2 card associated with the basic card.  If a user searches for a level 1 card, display the basic and level 2 card.  If the user searches for a level 2 card, display the level 1 and basic card.
